Model4You aims to help professional or amature models to get more exposure and hiring opportunities.


This my first project made for SoftUni ASP.NET Core project defense. 
Huge thanks to @NikolayIT for the template, as well one of the best lecturer at SoftUni.
Also huge thanks to @StoyanShopov for all of the help, support and knowledge he gives to the students.
